        </summary>
        <div class="pt-3">
          <p>
            Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to transmission of
            diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid
            and polio. Absent, inadequate, or inappropriately managed water and
            sanitation services expose individuals to preventable health risks.

        <summary class="fs-5">3-Is bottled water safer than tap water?</summary>
        <div class="pt-3">
          <p>
            bottled water had less bacteria in it than tap water in three out of
            four samples. But it's worth pointing out that both tap and bottled
            water have to adhere to strict safety standards so both are safe to
            drink.

        <div class="pt-3">
          <p>
            During filtration, the clear water passes through filters that have
            different pore sizes and are made of different materials (such as
            sand, gravel, and charcoal). These filters remove dissolved
            particles and germs, such as dust, chemicals, parasites, bacteria,
            and viruses.

        <div class="pt-3">
          <p>
            It is a complex system that includes many different processes.
            Liquid water evaporates into water vapor, condenses to form clouds,
            and precipitates back to earth in the form of rain and snow. Water
            in different phases moves through the atmosphere (transportation).
