                <p class="fw-medium fs-6"> <span class="fw-bold fs-5"></span> The water cycle shows the continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere. It is a complex system that includes many different processes. Liquid water evaporates into water vapor, condenses to form clouds, and precipitates back to earth in the form of rain and snow. Water in different phases moves through the atmosphere (transportation). Liquid water flows across land (runoff), into the ground (infiltration and percolation), and through the ground (groundwater). Groundwater moves into plants (plant uptake) and evaporates from plants into the atmosphere (transpiration). Solid ice and snow can turn directly into gas (sublimation). The opposite can also take place when water vapor becomes solid (deposition).</p>

                Filter the water using a cloth or coffee filter.
                If the water is still cloudy after filtering, leave the container to stand for half a day, then as the dirt settles at the bottom of the bottom, scoop the clean water and filter again.
                Boil for 2-3 minutes to kill all potential germs.
                *Once water has boiled, it is safe to drink.</p>
            <p class="fw-medium fs-5"> <span class="fw-bold text-success fs-5">Method-B:- Chemical:</span>Put 2 drops of 5% chlorine for every 1 liter of refrigerated water.  Leave for 1 hour.
                If after 1 hour there is no smell, repeat step.
                *If by the 3rd try, you still cannot detect the faint chlorine smell, throw the water away as it may contain germs.
